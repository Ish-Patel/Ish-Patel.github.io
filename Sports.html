				<h2>History</h2>
        			<p>FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed ten UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2016, Barcelona has never been relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and arch-rival Real Madrid.</p>
				<h2>Why</h2>
				<p>My favorite Sports is football(soccer). This is because it is a very endurance related game. My favorite team in this would be Barcelona, located in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. I like this team because of the energy and the teamwork of the whole team. I also like the team because it was the team that my friend introduced me to while watching soccer with him. A fact about them is that they have won 70 domestic titles and is considered the best team in spain.</p>

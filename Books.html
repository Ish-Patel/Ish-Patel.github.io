				<h2><center>Why</center></h2>
        			<p>A favorite book of mine is The Giver by: Lois Lowry. The is my favorite book because it shows an utopian society that has become a dystopian. The characters face many troubles through the story because there is one person who has all the knowledge and the rest don’t. The rest of the people go on their daily lives and don’t do unique things their jobs are assigned to them and they cannot see color. This is because in the society they took away all things that cause problems: color, snow, animals, and many other things.</p>
				<h2><center>Summary</center></h2>
				<p>The Giver by:Louis Lowry is a book about a young boy named Jonas, he lives in an isolated community from the rest of the world. Jonas was finally chosen to be the giver, a person that holds all restricted knowledge so the council members can ask for advice. As he begins to become the current givers apprentice he learns about many forbidden secrets like colors and animals. His father kills infants to control the population and when Jonas finds out he believes he father is a murderer. He then refuses to go home and comes up with the idea of leaving the community, when he does this the whole community will get all the memories returned to them. He then leaves with a child that his father was about to kill. This is where the story ends.</p>
				<h2><center>Characters</center></h2>
				<h3>Jonas</h3>
				<p>On the surface, Jonas is like any other eleven-year-old boy living in his community. He seems more intelligent and perceptive than many of his peers, and he thinks more seriously than they do about life, worrying about his own future as well as his friend Asher’s. He enjoys learning and experiencing new things: he chooses to volunteer at a variety of different centers rather than focusing on one, because he enjoys the freedom of choice that volunteer hours provide. He also enjoys learning about and connecting with other people, and he craves more warmth and human contact than his society permits or encourages. The things that really set him apart from his peers—his unusual eyes, his ability to see things change in a way that he cannot explain—trouble him, but he does not let them bother him too much, since the community’s emphasis on politeness makes it easy for Jonas to conceal or ignore these little differences.</p>
				<h3>The Giver</h3>
				<p>He looks ancient, but he is not old at all. Like someone who has seen and done many things over many years, he is very wise and world-weary, and he is haunted by memories of suffering and pain, but in reality his life has been surprisingly uneventful. In the world of the community, the Giver has spent most of his life inside his comfortable living quarters, eating his meals and emerging occasionally to take long walks. Yet he carries the memories of an entire community, so he feels like a man who has done more in his life than anyone else in the world: he has experienced the positive and negative emotions, desires, triumphs, and failures of millions of men and women, as well as animals. He is responsible for preserving those memories and using the wisdom they give him to make decisions for the community.</p>

                			<h2>Summary</h2>
        			  	<p>The first Transformers story begins with the history of the Transformers. On their home planet of Cybertron, there are two opposing factions: the Autobots and the Decepticons. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, are fighting to prevent the Decepticons from getting the AllSpark, a powerful artifact that would grant unlimited power to whoever possesses it. Determined not to allow the evil Megatron to get ahold of it, Optimus Prime sends the AllSpark into space. Megatron goes after it, but crashes into Earth’s Arctic Circle. He is discovered later by explorer Archibald Witwicky, who unknowingly activates Megatron. Megatron engraves the AllSpark’s location into Witwicky’s glasses, then sends the transmission back to Cybertron. When other Decepticons track down the glasses and attack Sam, his car suddenly springs to life – it is an Autobot. After saving Sam and his friend, they are introduced to the rest of the Autobots, who have just arrived on Earth. If Megatron and the Decepticons get ahold of the AllSpark, they plan on using it to bring to life all of Earth’s machinery and wiping out the human race. Most of the rest of the movie is just extended battles between various Transformers. It ends with the AllSpark being extinguished, most of the Decepticons either dying or escaping, and Optimus Prime salvaging a small shard of the AllSpark.</p>
        	      			<h2>Rating</h2>
                			<p>I think the movie was great especially at its time, 2007. It was good from the story, its originality, to its special effects. They had great actors and characters throughout the movie. Overall i would give the movie a 8.5/10.</p>
